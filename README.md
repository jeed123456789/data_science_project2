## Project description 
  The aim in this project was to find the correlation between various life factors to life expectnacy. I expected that GDP would have one   of the strongest correlation with life expectancy.
  
  Prior to settling with this topic, I had been looking around a topic concerning suicide rates and the happiness level. Even though I  could find data regarding the two topics, I was unable to find a way to express the correlation or causation that could be found by comparing the two datasets. Luckily, I was able to stumble into this topic and reach to a fair conclusion using the data I found.

## Data description
  The data was found in a well-known data community site called [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
  - [Data 1](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who): shows the life expectany for 260 nations since 1800 to 2016
  
  - [Data 2](https://www.kaggle.com/amarpandey/world-life-expectancy-18002016): shows the life expectancy for 194 countries and immunizaiton, expenditure, lifestyle-related data
