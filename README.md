  This project is another project from the [data_science_project](https://github.com/shpark61/data_science_project) which I participated in.
## Project description 
  The aim in this project was to find the correlation between various life factors to life expectnacy. I expected that GDP would have one   of the strongest correlation with life expectancy.
  
  Prior to settling with this topic, I had been looking around a topic concerning suicide rates and the happiness level. Even though I  could find data regarding the two topics, I was unable to find a way to express the correlation or causation that could be found by comparing the two datasets. Luckily, I was able to stumble in this topic and reach a fair conclusion using the data I found.

## Data description
  The data was found in a well-known data community site called [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
  - [Data 1](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who): shows the life expectany for 260 nations since 1800 to 2016
  - [Data 2](https://www.kaggle.com/amarpandey/world-life-expectancy-18002016): shows the life expectancy for 194 countries from 2000 to 2015 and immunizaiton, expenditure, lifestyle-related data
  
## Technology
  Python 3 was the language used similar to the previous project for the use of "pandas' and 'matplotlib' libraries to process, merge, and visualize data easily. All the files and contents were edited on an online web application, [Juypter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
  Documentation of previously mentioned libraries, pandas and matplotlib, can be found below:
  
      [pandas 0.25.0 documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
      
      [matplotlib 3.1.1 documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/contents.html)
